First thing I did was open up the terminal and type in "pwd". Then I typed in "ls -a". Then I typed in the command "vim .vimrc" which opened up a text editor which is where I proceped to type in what it has on the Lab Assignment instructions. Then I saved and quit the editor and used the command "cat .vimrc" which displayed what I had typed into the terminal. Then I proceeded to open up the VIM again to make see the color of the text which I had previously chosen. I procceeded to quit the VIM and save it to my desktop using "~/Desktop" as the directory. Now I have opened up the VIM again and proceeded to add this text to explain what I have done.
